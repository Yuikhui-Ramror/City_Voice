# **App Name**: CityVoice

## Core Features:

- Issue Posting: Allow citizens to post civic issues with photo, location tag, and text/voice note.
- Engagement Prioritization: Prioritize issues based on likes, shares, and comments. An AI tool decides which issues rise higher based on levels of community engagment, measured against various other metrics.
- Issue Tracking: Allow users to track the progress of their reports and receive stage-wise notifications (confirmation → acknowledgment → resolution).
- Filtering and Prioritization: Municipal staff can filter issues by category, location, or priority.
- Department Assignment: Municipal staff can assign reports to relevant departments (e.g., sanitation, public works).
- Status Updates: Municipal staff can update issue statuses and communicate progress.
- Automated Routing Engine: Route reports to the correct department based on metadata (category + location). An AI tool is used to classify an issue based on keywords in user posts.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL(210, 60%, 50%) which converts to RGB hex #4DA6FF; a vibrant, trustworthy blue.
- Background color: HSL(210, 20%, 95%) which converts to RGB hex #F0F5FF; a very light blue for a clean interface.
- Accent color: HSL(180, 60%, 40%) which converts to RGB hex #33A6A6; a contrasting teal to draw attention to important elements.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif), for a contemporary, techy feel; use 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text.
- Use consistent, simple icons from a modern icon set (e.g., Font Awesome or Material Design Icons) to represent issue categories and actions.
- Mobile-first design with a clear, single-column layout. Use cards to display individual issues, ensuring readability and scannability.
- Subtle animations (e.g., fading, sliding) when transitioning between views or updating issue statuses. Avoid excessive or distracting animations.
